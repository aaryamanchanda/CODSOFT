## 🎯 What I Learned During the CodSoft Internship
Through these tasks, I strengthened my understanding of:
- Python fundamentals  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Working with lists and strings  
- User input handling  
- Error handling (`try-except`)  
- Using Python's built-in modules (`random`, `string`)  
- Writing clean and readable CLI-based programs  

This internship helped me build confidence in Python and improve my problem-solving abilities with real mini-projects.
